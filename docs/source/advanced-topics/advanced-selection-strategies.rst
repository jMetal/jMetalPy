Advanced Selection Strategies
=============================

Implementing sophisticated solution selection mechanisms for multi-objective optimization.

.. note::
   üìù **Under Development**: This section is planned for future development.
   The :doc:`distance-based-archive` provides a concrete example of advanced selection strategies.

Overview
--------

Selection strategies determine which solutions to maintain in archives and populations during optimization. Advanced strategies can significantly improve optimization performance.

Planned Topics
--------------

**Distance-Based Selection**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Multi-Objective Distance Metrics**: Beyond Euclidean distance
* **Adaptive Distance Measures**: Context-aware distance calculations
* **Normalized vs Raw Objectives**: When and how to normalize

**Diversity Maintenance**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Crowding Distance Variations**: Improvements to standard crowding distance
* **Hypervolume-Based Selection**: Using hypervolume for selection
* **Reference Point Methods**: Selection with user preferences

**Performance Optimization**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Incremental Updates**: Efficient recomputation strategies
* **Approximate Methods**: Trading accuracy for speed
* **Parallel Selection**: Distributed selection algorithms

**Hybrid Approaches**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Multi-Criteria Selection**: Combining multiple selection criteria
* **Adaptive Strategies**: Changing selection during optimization
* **Problem-Specific Methods**: Tailored selection for specific domains

Examples to be Covered
----------------------

* **Knee Point Selection**: Identifying solutions at trade-off knees
* **User-Preference Integration**: Interactive selection strategies
* **Constraint-Aware Selection**: Handling feasibility in selection
* **Dynamic Population Sizing**: Adaptive archive and population sizes

Current Implementation
---------------------

The :doc:`distance-based-archive` demonstrates several advanced concepts:

* Adaptive strategy selection based on problem dimensionality
* Robust normalization handling edge cases
* Integration of crowding distance and distance-based methods
* Memory-efficient implementation patterns
