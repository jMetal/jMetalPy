Custom Archives
===============

Creating custom archive implementations for specialized optimization scenarios.

.. note::
   üìù **Under Development**: This section is planned for future development.
   For now, see the :doc:`distance-based-archive` guide for an example of advanced archive implementation.

Overview
--------

Custom archives allow you to implement specialized storage and selection strategies for optimization problems with unique requirements.

Planned Topics
--------------

* **Archive Interface**: Understanding the base Archive class
* **Selection Strategies**: Implementing custom selection criteria
* **Memory Management**: Efficient storage for large solution sets
* **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining multiple selection mechanisms
* **Domain-Specific Archives**: Archives optimized for specific problem types

Examples to be Covered
----------------------

* **Quality-Based Archives**: Selection based on multiple quality metrics
* **Constraint-Aware Archives**: Handling constrained optimization problems
* **Dynamic Archives**: Archives that adapt during optimization
* **Multi-Criteria Archives**: Complex trade-off management
